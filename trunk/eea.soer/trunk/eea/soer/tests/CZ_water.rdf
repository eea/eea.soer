		Clean water and its sufficient quantity is important how in light of nature, so also in the light of its utilization by humans.
		</keyMessage>
		<assessment>
		The Czech Republic is located at the watershed of three different seas and most of Czech watercourses flow off to neighbouring countries. Freshwater priority issues are related particularly to water quality and discharged pollution. Even though surface water quality has improved significantly since 1990s, attention still needs to be paid to the discharged pollution, respectively further wastewater treatment. Water quality is also affected by increasing number and extremity of floods and droughts connected to climate changes, so that longer retention of water in landscape and flood-protection measures are supported. In connection with more frequent droughts, continuing decrease of water abstractions in public sector and industry is rewarding.

		&lt;strong&gt;The development in the quality of watercourses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;A comparison of the maps from years 1991–1992 and 2007–2008 according to the national classification scheme makes it obvious that there has been a shift in water quality in watercourses from categories IV and V to categories I through III. Despite this rapid improvement there still exist a few sections of watercourses laying in the category V of water quality classification. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Average nutrients concentrations in freshwater show a slightly decreasing trend overall since 1990. In the period over the last 10 years, there was a stagnation of nitrates and a moderate decrease in the concentrations of phosphorus. Biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand concentrations decreased markedly and currently don’t present a problem. &lt;em&gt;Additional information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1775&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1775&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrates in drinking water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;The public water supply is of a good quality and has had no impacts on health in most cases. Problems with nitrates in drinking water are only casual in shallow water wells, usually because of agricultural activities. In 2002, the effect of huge floods affected the decline of groundwater quality. Since 2003, nitrogenous substances follow up to decrease. &lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&lt;strong&gt;Bathing water quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;&#10;Despite a general decrease of nutrients in tributaries, the long term trend of stagnant water quality cannot be estimated properly. Practically every year there are more or less problems with bathing water quality. Epidemic infection or health impairment wasn’t reported in the last few years. Bathing waters are continuously monitored by the Ministry of Health Care through the Public Health Service under the Bathing Water Directive 2006/7/ES. &lt;em&gt;Detailed information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://geoportal.cenia.cz&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://geoportal.cenia.cz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

		Changes in industry, public sector and waste water treatment present the main positive drivers and pressures influencing water quality.
		</keyMessage>
		<assessment>
		&lt;p class=&quot;btext_anot&quot;&gt;The reduction in water abstraction and relating amount of wastewater discharged into surface waters occurred in the context of declining industrial production due to the restructuring of the national economy and due to technological changes in the period after 1990. In the case of public water abstraction, decline was mainly due to reduced drinking water consumption and reduced losses in distribution systems. &lt;em&gt;Additional information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1772&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1772&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;Then the effects of &lt;strong&gt;construction and modernisation of waste water treatment (WWTPs) plants and sewerage systems&lt;/strong&gt; have helped significantly to decrease the pollution discharged into watercourses from point sources especially since the mid 1990s. The proportion of the population connected to public sewerage systems has increased from 72% in 1990 to 81.1% in 2008. The proportion of waste water (excluding rainwater) that is discharged into sewerage systems and that is treated increased from 75% to 95% between 1990 and 2008. Indeed, the percentage of tertiary treatment in new and modernized WWTPs, which helps to remove problematic nutrients, is increasing. The total number of WWTPs in the Czech Republic has more than tripled since 1990. At first, sewerage systems and WWTPs were completed in larger towns and cities. The coverage of smaller municipalities, where population density is lower, requires more financial resources, while the construction itself takes longer time. &lt;em&gt;Additional information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1776&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1776&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;The positive development in waste water treatment is supported by the obligation that follows from &lt;strong&gt;Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste-water treatment&lt;/strong&gt;. The decrease in phosphorus emissions is also supported by the &lt;strong&gt;prohibition of phosphates in detergents&lt;/strong&gt; since October 2006. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;strong&gt;Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt; represents the other source of nutrients in freshwater. After 1990, the consumption of inorganic fertilisers decreased significantly in connection with the transformation of agriculture and the increase of the cost of fertilisers. Since 1993 the consumption of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers started to increase, mainly to compensate for the decrease in applicated N from livestock manure production, especially due to the reduction in cattle. Since 2000, balance in inputs minus outputs increased to 60–73 kg N per ha that is reasonable for our climatic conditions. However we can see the problem of one-sided nitrogen inorganic fertilising. The loss of nitrogen into water from agriculture is influenced by erosion, soil compaction, inappropriate agricultural techniques and storage of fertilisers and livestock manure. The average loss of nitrogen into water from agriculture in Czech conditions is approximately 2/3 of the balance. &lt;em&gt;Additional information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://issar.cenia.cz/issar/page.php?id=1700&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Under construction, coming soon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The presented estimate of future evaluation is only indicative because of the unavoidable uncertainty in the forecast and the delayed effect of measures on the aquatic environment. Surface water profiles and groundwater sites that exhibit a substantial delay in the decrease in nitrate concentrations below a level of 50 mg. l-1 or in which an increasing trend was even recorded represent a special category (IV) in the performed assessment. Most of these sites confirmed the justification of the revision of vulnerable zones in 2007. Consequently, greater attention in the application of action programmes will be focused on these monitoring sites and on their river basins or the relevant groundwater area. &lt;em&gt;Additional information: Report of the Czech Republic according to Council Directive 91/676/EEC, 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
