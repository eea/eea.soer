eea.soer install instructions
=============================

The eea.soer product sets up a few content types using the default Plone 2.x/3.x
content type system 'Archetypes'. This product is thus not designed to work
with newer systems such as dexterity.

Aside from Archetypes, only a thin product, eea.vocab, is required to get this
product running on a basic Plone 2.5 installation (3.x has yet not been
tested).

 1. Copy these lines to your src/EXTERNALS.txt file:
   eea.soer https://github.com/eea/eea.soer
   eea.vocab https://github.com/eea/eea.vocab

 2. Tell SVN to use these on your src folder by running the command:
   svn ps svn:externals -F src/EXTERNALS.txt src

 3. Configure the appropriate buildout sections:
   buildouteggs =
       eea.soer
       eea.vocab
   developeggs =
       src/eea.soer
       src/eea.vocab
   buildoutcommonzcml =
       eea.soer
       eea.vocab

 4. Rerun buildout and start the instance:
   bin/buildout
   bin/instance fg

 5. In the management interface, navigate to portal_quickinstaller, check
    the boxes for eea.soer and eea.vocab and then press 'Install'.

 6. Using Plone CMS interface, you should now be able to create a folder and
    start adding commonality/diversity/flexibility reports. Good Luck!
